	   	 	When Rupert Sterling, an exchange student from Antigua, arrived in New York 			City in the early ‘60s, the steel pan was in its infancy and little was known 			about the instrument outside of Trinidad and Tobago, its mother country. Murray 			Narell, a social worker in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, met Sterling, 			who was soon teaching pan to impoverished youths in gangs under Narell’s 			direction.
			</p>
			<p>
	    	Pan was implemented as a social work program in hopes of steering the teens 			off the streets and giving them something constructive and collaborative to 			do. Soon, the teens were doing exactly that, their enthusiasm so radiant that 			Narell’s two young sons, Jeff and Andy, began to drum along. The Narell brothers 			began performing with neighborhood friends in their band The Steel Bandits. More 			than just a clever name, The Steel Bandits became something of a local novelty, 			and their rise to semi-stardom over the following years included appearances 			on national TV, an LP, and an invitation to Trinidad’s National Music Festival.
			</p>

			<h1><em>Andy Narell's Journey</em></h1>

			<p>
	    	Thus, the steel pan career of Andy Narell was launched. However, his success 			has not been without controversy. From a general dislike of foreigners rooted in 			colonialism to flat out rejection of his music by Trinidad natives, Narell's 			acceptance among those who created the very instrument which he loves has been a 			career long struggle. Today, he is regarded as one of the most influential 			pannists of all time, combining Afro-Carib and jazz styles, among many others, 			to produce innovative music complemented by the beauty of the steel pan. Andy 			Narell is now the most widely recorded steel pan player in the world with over 15 			records to his name alongside his collaborations with Chucho Valdes and Aretha 			Franklin.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			Born on March 18th, 1954 in New York City, Andy Narell wasn't always destined 			for a career in music. Even during the years of The Steel Bandits, Andy assumed 			he would be in school for a long time and go on to become a doctor or 			scientist. It wasn't until Narell was halfway through college that he realized 			he was still more interested in music than anything else. In a 2003 interview 			with When Steel Talks, Andy explains his reasons for choosing pan: “I guess I 			always felt that it was the thing I had grown up with, and I felt identified with 			it and could visualize it as my voice, and hopefully I could make a contribution 			and say something original.”

			<h1><em>Panorama '99</em></h1>

			<p>
			One Friday in September of 1998, Andy himself would embark on a journey that 			would change steel band music forever. On his desk lay a letter from Junior 			Regrello, leader of a top band in Trinidad called Skiffle Bunch, and inside 			was an invitation to compose and arrange an original song for Skiffle to 			perform for the 1999 Panorama competition. This was the first time that a steel 			band placed its faith in the hands of a foreigner. Andy’s invitation was made 			even more controversial by the fact that he was a white, American man, far from a 			native Trinidadian. As Andy would soon learn, Trinis can be very possessive of 			their national instrument and anything to do with it. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Andy wanted to make a statement at the 1999 Panorama, and his intent was 			clear in the letter he wrote in response to Regrello’s invitation: “If you don't 			think that most of the bands play too fast and too loud, you shouldn't hire me 			because I do. I would rather come in tenth and hear that everybody’s arguing over 			whether it was the most beautiful tune in the Panorama or a bunch of shit than 			come in third and hear everybody say that Andy Narell finally came down here to 			do a tune and he had nothing to say.” As it turns out, he did have something 			to say. Andy took the arranging job at Skiffle Bunch and proceeded to craft a 			song unlike any panorama tune the crowd at Panorama had seen: Coffee Street. 			Named after the road on which Skiffle Bunch’s panyard was located, Coffee Street 			was Andy Narell’s first and likely most famous panorama, and in his eyes, “at 			some point, you either gotta put up or shut up... If you have an opinion about 			how they should be doin’ this instead of doin’ that, shut up and go do it!” 
			</p>

			<p>
		 Skiffle ended up placing eighth out of 12, stunning bands below them like 		Invaders and Starlift. While his band didn't win, his tune had people talking. The 		jazzy, smooth, yet up-tempo Coffee Street had forever changed people’s opinions 		on Panorama. The tonal quality and balance of the sections within the band as a 		whole were unlike anything in Panorama before. There were still critics, but as 		one Trinidadian in Skiffle pointed out, “by next year people will be loving this 		tune, and plenty [of] arrangers will be stealing pieces of it.” From his early days 		with The Steel Bandits to his debut Panorama with Skiffle Bunch, Andy Narell has 		been nothing short of a true “panman.” His desire to constantly innovate and change 		the way steel pan is perceived around the world is his greatest trait. There will 		always be people who don't agree with Narell or his tunes, but his legacy will live 		on as pan continues to evolve into a worldwide instrument.

			<h1><em>Pans</em></h1>
			<p>
			During British colonial rule, a ban was upheld for many years prohibiting the 			use of any drums or percussion instruments. Drums were an integral 	part of the 			African slave’s religious observance and served as a way to communicate with 			their deities. East Indian migrants also brought their own traditional drumming 			practices to Trinidad. While their culture was not censored in the way the 			Africans’ was, the Empire still imposed restrictions on their drumming which 			created a cross-cultural empathy between the oppressed. 
			</p>
				<img src="images/Ellie_Mannette.jpg" width="400" height="219" 				class="fltright" alt="Ellie Mannette">
			<p>
			To work around the ban on drums, the Africans turned to what is now known as 			tamboo bamboo. Tamboo bamboo bands consist of bamboo cut in different lengths 			which are beat on the ground. These instruments were soon banned when it was 			discovered that, due to the bamboo being sharpened to a point, they were being 			used as weapons by rival tamboo bamboo gangs. Due to the poverty of these 			communities, they could not purchase materials for traditional instruments like 			the piano and violin. They instead turned to metal objects like paint cans, 			garbage can covers, and old brake drums to produce musical sound. These early 			experimenters, due to their low socioeconomic status, were viewed as outcasts of 			society. On top of that, the early steel bands which arose from these experiments 			would engage in competition that often ended in violence. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
			Trial and error soon led to the first 4-note pan made by Winston “Spree” 			Simon. His first pan was a simple, one-note kettle drum which he loaned out and 			upon return it was misshapen. While working to repair the note, he discovered 			that he could produce varying sounds and pitches depending on the point and 			strength which he hammered. He shared this knowledge with the other members 			of his band, and pan was born. He soon developed an 8-note “ping-pong” pan, 			and by 1946, eight notes became 14 notes. Winston and his band went on to 			perform abroad in various parts of the world, playing widely accepted music 			favored by the middle and upper classes, catapulting pan’s acceptance around 			the world and in Trinidad as a true musical instrument. The steel drum orchestra 			was able to flourish, removed from past associations with gangs and violence. 			That previous competition, marked by violence which relegated pan to the depths 			of society, was now ready to take center stage as a source of great national 			pride. 

			<p>
	   		In 1967,​ ​Murray​ ​Narell​, Andy's father, ​arranged​ ​for​ Ellie ​Mannette​ 			​to​ ​come​ ​to​ 	New​ ​York​ ​to​ ​spread​ ​pan​ ​across​ America. From​ 			​there,​ ​Mannette​ ​was​ ​able​ ​to​ ​lead​ the​ ​way​ ​for​ ​the​ 			​development, ​evolution​, and ​perfection of​ ​pan​ itself​ ​and​ ​the​ 			​art​ of​ ​pan​ ​building​. Today, the once 14-note “lead” tenor pan now has 32 			notes. With notes from middle C to high G, the tenor pan is the highest voice 			in the steel orchestra. The tenor is followed, in descending order by range, by 			the Double Tenor, Double Second, Triple Guitar, Cello, and Bass pans. 			Together these pans create what is known today as the steel orchestra, although 			there many other variant pan types such as the Invader Lead, Quaduet, and the 			Quadraphonic. Commonly found pans are listed in the table below along with their 			range and inventor. Notice the significance of Mr. Mannette "Father of Steel Pan" 			in the creation of most of the pans we see today. Mannette passed away on the 			29th of August, 2018.

					My name is Sam Puritz. I am a sophmore pre-ICT student at FSU and 					have played steel drums for six years at this point. While music and pan 					do not directly relate to my major, it has played a major role in my life 					and is a great passion of mine. I have spent countless hours practicing, 					performing, and researching pan. I wanted to create this page because I 					noticed a lack of quality, informative websites regarding pan on the 					Internet, so this project is fulfilling to me and feels like a service to 					the pan community
