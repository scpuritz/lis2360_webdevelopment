                <h1>Privacy in the 21st Century</h1>
                
                    <h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
                        <p>In the past decade, our world has become increasingly connected through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. With the number of users online growing exponentially, Facebook alone with over a billion users, people across the globe have been sharing, commenting, and “liking” more than ever before. With this, the information, both private and public, of over two billion people on social media is placed in a precarious position. On the surface, it may seem safe, even advantageous, to share as much as possible on a social media platform. By doing so, however, one relinquishes enormous amounts of privacy and information to companies with a monetary incentive to distribute that information as well as hackers with malicious intent. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>Every individual has a right to privacy and autonomy. Despite a push to prioritize the personal interests and privacy of the individual, data breaches of large companies, including those outside of the social media realm, have become all too common. In these data breaches, personal information from first and last names to social security numbers are stolen to be used for identity theft among other cybercrime. Even when a user’s information is stored securely, the companies that do so often sell it to advertisers and other firms. Once in the hands of the third party, sensitive information is often used irresponsibly. The problem, unfortunately, goes further. 
                        </p> 
                        <p>Outside of instances in which users voluntarily fill out information forms when signing up for a platform or service, many websites employ tracking methods with cookies. Through cookies, sites are able to acquire massive amounts of information on an individual by recording their browsing history in an extremely invasive way. With the emergence of IVAs (Intelligent Virtual Assistant) and AI, this problem becomes more pressing. Hackers and commercial entities alike, with access to a single IVA-device, have the potential to wreak havoc in one’s life and invade their privacy in ways unlike anything previously possible. If one values their privacy and autonomy, this issue is both an important and complex one.

                        <h2><em>The Social Media Paradox</em></h2>
                            <p>To examine the problem of privacy on social media, and internet services in general, one must first examine the paradox it creates. Users of social media are, for the large majority, unaware of the scope of the privacy risks it presents. This can be tied to the fact that many consents and End-User License Agreements (EULA) are often hidden, lengthy, and problematic on social media sites. In a study conducted by Mary Jane Kwok Choon at the Université du Québec à Montréal, Choon’s findings were, while not surprising, quite telling. In the study, students were reluctant to conceal personal information because it limited the ways in which they could connect and gain popularity with their followers (Choon). 
                            </p>
                            <p>This is where the paradox begins. Users know that, by sharing on social media, they are relinquishing some of their privacy. By not sharing, however, they lose what they perceive as “popularity” online. Choon found that most users were concerned with control of their information when interacting with someone else, but cared less about the privacy of that same information when used by third parties and commercial entities. Choon says this paradox is created by limited knowledge and low visibility of third-party surveillance practices, the perception of control over the publication of information in context, and limited trust in followers/friends on social media (Choon). The desire to share and have “status” within one’s social group also plays a role in creating this social media privacy paradox.
