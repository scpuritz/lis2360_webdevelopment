                <h2><em>The Social Media Paradox</em></h2>
                    <p>To examine the problem of privacy on social media, and internet services in general, one must first examine the paradox it creates. Users of social media are, for the large majority, unaware of the scope of the privacy risks it presents. This can be tied to the fact that many consents and End-User License Agreements (EULA) are often hidden, lengthy, and problematic on social media sites. In a study conducted by Mary Jane Kwok Choon at the Université du Québec à Montréal, Choon’s findings were, while not surprising, quite telling. In the study, students were reluctant to conceal personal information because it limited the ways in which they could connect and gain popularity with their followers (Choon). 
                    </p>
                    <p>This is where the paradox begins. Users know that, by sharing on social media, they are relinquishing some of their privacy. By not sharing, however, they lose what they perceive as “popularity” online. Choon found that most users were concerned with control of their information when interacting with someone else, but cared less about the privacy of that same information when used by third parties and commercial entities. Choon says this paradox is created by limited knowledge and low visibility of third-party surveillance practices, the perception of control over the publication of information in context, and limited trust in followers/friends on social media (Choon). The desire to share and have “status” within one’s social group also plays a role in creating this social media privacy paradox.
